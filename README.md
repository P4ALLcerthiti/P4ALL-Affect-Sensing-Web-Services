# P4ALL - Affect Sensing Web Services

A module that enables stress detection through features extracted by Emphatical Sensors.
The Final Version is assessed and validated by the data produced by the [ProComp5 Infiniti Hardware](http://thoughttechnology.com/index.php/hardware/procomp5-infiniti-5-channel-biofeedback-neurofeedback-system-w-biograph-infiniti-software.html) paired with the [ SA9309M skin conductance sensor](http://thoughttechnology.com/index.php/sensors-83/skin-conductance-sensor.html) and the [ EKGâ„¢ Sensor - T9306M ](http://thoughttechnology.com/index.php/sensors-83/ekgtm-sensor.html). 

The source code contains two main directories:

1) [Affect Sensing Module](https://github.com/P4ALLcerthiti/P4ALL-Affect-Sensing-Module/tree/master/Source%20Code/Affect_Sensing_Module): This folder includes the cpp and the 2 header files that produce the features needed for stress detection.

2) [Affect Sensing Module Desktop App](https://github.com/P4ALLcerthiti/P4ALL-Affect-Sensing-Module/tree/master/Test%20Application): This folder includes the test App for the Affect Sensing Module
